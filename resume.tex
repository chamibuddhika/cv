		\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Intern}{Science Gateways Center}{2018 Summer} 
			\begin{itemize}
			  \item Developed Kisseru, a Python library for scripting scientific dataflows. Features a lightweight
				  embedded DSL which generates and optimizes the data flow graph and run it locally or on Slurm cluster
				  runtime.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}


		\begin{cvsubsection}{Research Assistant}{Indiana University}{2015 -- Present}			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed Liteinst , a lightweight runtime binary instrumentation frameworkfor x86. This work was published in PLDI-16 and PLDI-17. It has zero overhead when turned off and does not require expensive traps or stopping the application to inject probes.
				\item Wrote an algebraic data type serializer as a part of Gibbon research compiler which operates on packed memory representations of ASTs to yield performance gains of 2x in some cases. This work was published in ECOOP-17.
				\item Developed a nonblocking I/O library and related benchmarks on top of Concurrent Cilk workstealing parallel runtime research prototype. The related work was published in LCPC-15.
				\item Integrated HPX, a C based asynchronous many task runtime as a Haberno CnC backend target. This work entailed generating HPX C code from the CnC DSL specification using a Python template library.
			\end{itemize}
